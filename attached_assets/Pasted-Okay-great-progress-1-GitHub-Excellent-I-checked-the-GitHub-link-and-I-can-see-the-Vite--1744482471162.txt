Okay, great progress!

1.  **GitHub:** Excellent! I checked the GitHub link, and I can see the Vite + React project files are successfully pushed there now. This means your code is safely backed up and version controlled.
2.  **Replit Console:** Thanks for sharing the console output. This tells us exactly what's happening:
    * The Vite development server (`npm run dev`) is starting correctly (`VITE v6.2.6 ready...`).
    * **However, it's immediately running into errors.** The key message is repeated multiple times:
        ```
        Failed to resolve import "./views/PaperUpload" from "src/App.jsx". Does the file exist?
        ```
        It also shows similar errors for `./views/Leaderboard` and `./views/Login`.

**What This Means:**

The main file controlling your app's layout (`src/App.jsx`) has been modified. It now includes lines trying to `import` (load) other code files like `PaperUpload`, `Leaderboard`, and `Login` from a folder named `views`.

The problem is that **these files or the `views` folder likely haven't been created yet**, so Vite can't find them, causing the error and preventing the app preview from loading correctly.

**What to Do Next: Fix the Errors**

Let's temporarily undo those changes in `App.jsx` to get the app running again. Then, we can create the necessary folders and files properly.

1.  **Open the File:** In your Replit file explorer (left sidebar), navigate to the `src` folder and click on the `App.jsx` file to open it in the editor.
2.  **Comment Out Problem Lines:** Find the lines that are trying to import the components causing errors. Based on the error log, these are likely around lines 22, 25, and 26:
    ```javascript
    // Likely around line 22:
    import PaperUpload from "./views/PaperUpload"; 

    // Likely around line 25:
    import Leaderboard from "./views/Leaderboard";

    // Likely around line 26:
    import Login from "./views/Login"; 
    ```
    * Add `//` at the very beginning of each of these lines. This tells JavaScript to ignore them for now. They should look like this:
        ```javascript
        // import PaperUpload from "./views/PaperUpload"; 
        // import Leaderboard from "./views/Leaderboard";
        // import Login from "./views/Login"; 
        ```
3.  **Comment Out Usage (If Any):** Scroll down further in `App.jsx`. If you see `PaperUpload`, `Leaderboard`, or `Login` being used anywhere (often inside `< >` brackets like `<PaperUpload />`), add `//` at the beginning of those lines too, or delete them for now if it's easier. The goal is to remove all references to these non-existent components.
4.  **Check the Preview:** Replit and Vite should automatically detect the changes to `App.jsx`. The console might show some activity, and the errors should disappear. The **WebView** preview tab should update and likely show the original Vite + React welcome page again (or whatever was working before these imports were added).

**Please perform these steps (commenting out the imports and usage in `src/App.jsx`) and let me know if the errors in the console go away and the preview loads without crashing.**

Once we have a stable, working state again, our next step will be to correctly create the `views` folder and start building those component files one by one.
