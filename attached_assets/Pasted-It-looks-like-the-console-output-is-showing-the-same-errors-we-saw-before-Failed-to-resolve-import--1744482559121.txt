It looks like the console output is showing the same errors we saw before: Failed to resolve import "./views/PaperUpload", Failed to resolve import "./views/Leaderboard", etc., all coming from the src/App.jsx file.

This means the changes we discussed (commenting out those specific import lines in src/App.jsx) haven't been applied or saved yet. The app is still trying to load files from the ./views/ folder that don't exist, which is causing the crash.

Let's try that fix again:

Find the File: In your Replit file list on the left, make sure you have the src folder open, and click on App.jsx to open it in the editor.
Edit the Code: Find these lines (the line numbers might be slightly different, but look for the import statements):
JavaScript

import PaperUpload from "./views/PaperUpload"; 
import Leaderboard from "./views/Leaderboard";
import Login from "./views/Login"; 
// You might also have imports for PaperReader, Games, Dashboard etc. from "./views/..."
Add //: Add // at the very beginning of each line that tries to import something from ./views/.... For example:
JavaScript

// import PaperUpload from "./views/PaperUpload"; 
// import Leaderboard from "./views/Leaderboard";
// import Login from "./views/Login"; 
// import Dashboard from "./views/Dashboard"; 
// import PaperReader from "./views/PaperReader";
// import Games from "./views/Games"; 
Comment Out Usage: Look further down in the App.jsx file (likely inside the return (...) block). If you see any of those names being used as tags (e.g., <PaperUpload />, <Dashboard />, <Login />), add // at the beginning of those lines too. If they are part of a list or structure, you might need to comment out a larger block, or simply delete those specific tags for now.
Save & Observe: Replit usually auto-saves. Watch the Console and the WebView preview. The errors should disappear from the console, and the preview should hopefully load the default React page without crashing.
Could you please try editing the src/App.jsx file as described above? Let me know if you can find the lines and comment them out, and whether the errors stop afterward. If you're having trouble finding the file or editing it, just let me know!
